Yesterday we talked about how to crush vendor call and pass on client interview 

So I learn a lot from yesterday’s meeting I was able to know how easily get things done that needs to be done.
The first scenario was mapping the requirement with resume and get the best out of it and make myself ready on for the questions that I will face the future including study and put more pressure to learn more and get to know everything 
Second 
Learn from mistakes which means I believe more practice can make me perfect so you help me to push more effort on things that I want. Depend on that I am putting more effort on doing things. If I got confused asking google is the best way to find answer and get more knowledge in addition to ask sir about what I need to know. The thing is maybe I don’t know or I don’t clearly understand what google says so I ask people who understand better than me and that’s why you here for us
I learn a new thing which is how to get the answer for a question within few seconds and get rid of confusion so that makes me hopeful to get learn fast
Generally to crush the vendor and client interview working hard is the best way. I prefer myself I have to work hard on and focus on learn new things.
